Until now（2023 Spring）, I am a sophomore physics student from [Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/).By the way, I graduated from Hefei 168 Middle School(http://www.hf168.net/index.html)

My academic tutor is [Prof.Wang Gan](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/english-wang-gan.html).

In fact, I spent this summer studying and researching quantum simulation in Professor [Fan Jingyun](https://sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/fanjingyun.html)'s Precision Measurement Laboratory with researcher [Li Zhengda](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/lizhengda.html) from [Shenzhen International Quantum Academy](https://www.sziqa.ac.cn/).

My home page will record my research interests (especially in physics) so that I can communicate with more excellent people.
