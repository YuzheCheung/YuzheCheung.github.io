My name is Yuzhe Cheung (张宇哲 in Chinese). I am 19 years old. Why do not I use Yuzhe Zhang as my English name (Guess?). 

My [MBTI](https://www.16personalities.com/) type is INFJ.

Until now（2023 Fall）, I am a Junior physics student from [Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/).By the way, I graduated from [Hefei 168 Middle School](http://www.hf168.net/index.html) in 2021.

My academic tutor is [Prof.Wang Gan](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/english-wang-gan.html). And he is teaching me the course 'Thin Film Physics' this term.

In fact, I spent this summer studying in Professor [Fan Jingyun](https://sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/fanjingyun.html)'s Precision Measurement Laboratory with researcher [Li Zhengda](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/lizhengda.html) from [Shenzhen International Quantum Academy](https://www.sziqa.ac.cn/).

Also Professor [Liu Weiping] is also guiding me in my study of nuclear physics experiments.

My homepage will track my research interests (especially in physics) so that I can communicate with more excellent people.
