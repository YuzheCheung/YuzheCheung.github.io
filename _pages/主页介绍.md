My name is Yuzhe Cheung (张宇哲 in Chinese). I am 19 years old (as of Nov 2023). Why do not I use Yuzhe Zhang as my English name (Guess?fine, because the surname "Cheung" follows the Cantonese pronunciation of 张, which is quite common in southern Chin). 

My [MBTI](https://www.16personalities.com/) type is INFJ.

Until now(as of 2023 Fall), I am a Junior physics student from Department of Physics, College of Science,[Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/).BTW, I graduated from [Hefei 168 Middle School](http://www.hf168.net/index.html) in 2021.

My academic tutor is [Prof.Wang Gan](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/english-wang-gan.html). And he is teaching me the course 'Thin Film Physics' this term (as of 2023 Fall).

In fact, I spent this summer studying in Professor [Fan Jingyun](https://sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/fanjingyun.html)'s Precision Measurement Laboratory with researcher [Li Zhengda](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/lizhengda.html) from [Shenzhen International Quantum Academy](https://www.sziqa.ac.cn/). Up until now (2024 Oct), I have been conducting research and studying quantum information and quantum computation (QIQC) in this lab, and Professor Fan has been extremely nice and supportive. 

Also Professor [Liu Weiping] is also guiding me in my study of nuclear physics experiments.

My favorite sports is Basketball and Swimming. Also I really into watching movies, especially art films and science fiction. I'm also a huge (EMO core) rock music fan.

My homepage will track my research interests (especially in physics) so that I can communicate with more excellent people.
